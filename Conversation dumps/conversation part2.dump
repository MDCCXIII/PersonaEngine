I want to re-make mood

7 emotions (primary) -     	furious 		- irritated 	- frustrated 	- calm 		- content - joyful 		- elated
Mood (Scale)            -1 <----------------------------------------------------0-----------------------------------------> +1  
7 outlook (secondary) 	disillusioned 	- pessimistic 	- skeptical 	- realistic - hopeful - optimistic - idealistic

Furious – intense, explosive anger
Irritated – annoyed, bothered, short-tempered
Frustrated – upset due to obstacles or unmet expectations
Calm – emotionally neutral, steady
Content – quietly satisfied, at ease
Joyful – visibly happy, uplifted
Elated – intensely happy, euphoric

Disillusioned – deeply skeptical, often bitter from past disappointments
Pessimistic – expects negative outcomes, sees flaws and risks
Skeptical – questions motives and outcomes, cautious but not hopeless
Realistic – grounded, sees both pros and cons without emotional bias
Hopeful – leans positive, sees potential but acknowledges challenges
Optimistic – expects good outcomes, focuses on opportunities
Idealistic – driven by high ideals, believes in the best of people and possibilities

these are all currently in default order
now you apply a bias (player choice) on a single emotion and a single outlook (this says how they want their character to be mood wise most of the time
if you imagine each base mood having an equal length on the line, when the character picks a bias, that bias increases the length of that mood on the line and progressively lessens the line length of other moods as you move away in either direction of the bias choice
the further away the mood from the bias the shorter the line gets (but overall both primary and secondary lines stay the same overall length)
now you add weights to each of these moods based on character stats then you sort the each on their line by order of weight
then you say the character always starts out on a value that is middle of their bias mood
now as events happen in game you give those event types a positive or negative value (possibly with mulitplier)
events move the characters value on the scale (ranging from -1 to +1) and time will always degrade at a base speed (we may possibly give bonuses or multipliers to this base rate depending on activity or freequency of - and + values on the scale) (eg. its bad it good it bad its good ... fuck my character is going nuts, one moment hes happy then furious then stoic and existential)

the weights then change with the character as the character grows because of stats
and the events are constantly giving pushes to extremes or different moods
time heals all

but mood can then decide what kind of phrase we say

we can then allow users to bind phrases to the different moods available

finally we should allow the configuration of dynamic phrases for anything we can bind phrases to by adding into the phrase box a line like 
({beginning} are of the {ending})
then another line like -- (example base phrase for reference: My devices are of the utmost quality and craftsmanship!)
beginning=my devices, the gadgets i envent, my schematics, devices spawned from my nether regions
ending=utmost quality and craftsmanship, utmost pain in my assmanship, crude yet informative type, most deadly in the universe

on save we add the sentence format and build the actual lists to feed it in the back end bound by the action/mood/character id
