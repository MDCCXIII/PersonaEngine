I want the user to be able to make as complexe of a sentence structure as they like though, I dont want to limit them, the rule is
Sentence format line: ({must}{match})
Key values: must= you seem,i'm,he's,she's,they are
Key values: match=bored

We can enforce this format and validate on save error ingredients if typos or bad syntax
